# gdrive-status

This is a simple script to parse the output of `drive diff` in [odeke-em/drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive) and make it look more like the output of `git status`. 

I would love to have this as standard functionality in the `drive` project, but I had to build this quickly and had no time to learn Go and dive into the code to contribute. If anyone wants this please let me know and I'll try my best to put this into the main project.
